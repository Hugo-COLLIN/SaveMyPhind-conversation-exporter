Hoora! The file name now contains the tool used (New Phind or Basic search). In addition, some format bugs are solved...

You can now export a Phind thread using the button inside the page (but you always can click on the extension icon).

⨠ Export all your threads in 1 click!
Just click on the "Export All Threads" button! It could be long, so you have time to drink your triple coffee dose 🙃.

File names, title bugs, these kind of things...


# Copilot proposals
the extension icon is now a bit more... "Phind"!
