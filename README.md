## 🚀 Behind the scenes

### 🤯 A challenging development
Chatbots are constatly changing their interfaces. That makes developing Save my Chatbot a wild adventure. Here are some of the challenges I tackle:
- **Interface Changes**: Regular updates to fix broken exports, incorrect formatting, and content extraction issues.
- **New Chatbots**: Each chatbot has its unique interface, so I dive into the page source code to understand its structure and what I need to extract to create a clean export file.
- **Code Maintainability**: Enhancing the codebase to ensure it remains clean, understandable, and adaptable.
- **Feature Expansion**: Adding more features to enhance user experience.
