### 🚀 Download your Phind, Perplexity and MaxAI-Google search threads into markdown files!

## 🗺️ Quick start

<h3>
  <a href="https://save.hugocollin.com/get">⏩ Install Save my Chatbot on Firefox and Chromium browsers</a>
</h3>

&#x2A20; It's **available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, Brave, and many more...** 😉

### ❓ How to use?
Simple!
1. **Go to a chat page**: Phind, Perplexity or Google (with MaxAI integration).
2. **Click on the extension icon.**

👉 It will **automatically download a structured markdown file** containing the conversation.

### 😎 Why Save my Chatbot?
- To **keep AI generated information offline**,
- To **read and process** in a knowledge base / note-taking app (like Obsidian),
- To **share threads with others**.

✅ Enjoy!

✏️ Please note that this project is not affiliated with Phind, Perplexity nor MaxAI.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### 🚀 In the pipeline...
- [ ] Custom file header
- [ ] Phind: Export tables into markdown

### 🎯 Main features:
- [x] Export chats from Phind, Perplexity and MaxAI-Google
- [x] Clean markdown formatting and structuring
- [x] Keep numbered sources in the exported file
- [x] Informative file header and filename (date, url...)
- [x] Indicates the chatbot response mode used (Phind-Search and Perplexity)
- [x] Informative modals (updates...)

### 🤯 The most important things I keep improving / fixing:
- Because chatbots are constantly changing their interfaces: Fix broken export, wrong formatting and content extracted.
- Improve code maintainability
